If the numbers 1 to 5 are written out in words: one, two, three, four, five, then there are 3 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 19 letters used in total.

If all the numbers from 1 to 1000 (one thousand) inclusive were written out in words, how many letters would be used?


NOTE: Do not count spaces or hyphens. For example, 342 (three hundred and forty-two) contains 23 letters and 115 (one hundred and fifteen) contains 20 letters. The use of "and" when writing out numbers is in compliance with British usage.

将整数1到5用英文单词写出，我们得到one, two, three, four, five,一共用了19个字母.

如果从1到1000（含1000）的数都用英文单词写出，一共会用到多少个字母？

（提示：不计空格和连接符.例如，342（three hundred and forty-two）包含23个字母；115（one hundred and fifteen）包含20个字母.“and”的用法以英式规则为准.）
